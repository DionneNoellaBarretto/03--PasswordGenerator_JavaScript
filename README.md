# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

```
This week‚Äôs homework requires starter code modification to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they‚Äôve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters.
